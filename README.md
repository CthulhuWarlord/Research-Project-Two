An Exploration in Polygon-Ellipse Approximations

Applications include Orbital Dynamics and Cryptography.
Goal similar as Polygon-Circle Approximation.

Difficulties include Ellipses not well understood, what is known is secret.

Best approach appears to define the Ellipse in terms of one radius from center.
One radius is not a fixed length, but an equation.
The equation must govern the sweep from 0 to 1 where 0 is the origin and 1 is the origin in a full period.
Good tactic: Use major axis of length 1, allow movement of minor axis and point C (the focii).
This is a rough-attempt. I'm not sure this has been done before. If I were to invest heavy amounts of time I would want to proceed in such a fashion.
Having a unit-ellipse solved would drastically simplify the problem.
I am unsure as to how to divide polygon sections. I am thinking portions of equal area inspired by the atrodynamic approach.
